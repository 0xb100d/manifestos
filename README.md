# manifestos aka grinoire
hacker/cypherpunk/etc historical writing in one place

these are the basis for the first edition of the GRINOIRE anthology of cypherpunk related texts and histories. Please submit pull requests with what you think should be included. More than happy to have the GRINOIRE be 2,000 pages, but even then not everything will make the cut. All types of contributions still gratefully accepted.
